## Introduction

Sentiment analysis is a common task in NLP, aiming to determine the sentiment expressed in text data. This project demonstrates the implementation of a RBF Kernel SVM classifier to analyze and classify restaurant reviews as either positive or negative.

## Project Structure

- `sentiment_analysis.py`: Python script containing the code for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- `Restaurant_Reviews.tsv`: Dataset containing restaurant reviews and their corresponding sentiment labels.
- `README.md1`: Project documentation.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- NLTK

You can install the required packages using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn nltk
```
## Execution

Follow the notebook for training, building and validating the model.

## Conclusion
This NLP sentiment analysis project demonstrates the application of text preprocessing and machine learning techniques for classifying restaurant reviews. By leveraging a Naive Bayes classifier, we can build a model capable of accurately categorizing the sentiment of textual data.
